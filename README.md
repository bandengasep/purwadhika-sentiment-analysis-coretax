# Business Problem Understanding
## **Background**

In early January, the Directorate General of Taxes (DGT) at Indonesia’s Ministry of Finance officially launched the Core Tax Administration System (CORETAX), an integrated, technology-based tax administration system. CORETAX is designed to streamline tax administration processes and enhance the tax database, aiming to improve efficiency, accuracy, and compliance in Indonesia’s tax ecosystem. Given the crucial role of taxation in national revenue, the successful implementation of this system is essential for both the government and taxpayers.

Despite its ambitious objectives and significant investment—amounting to IDR 1.3 trillion—CORETAX has encountered numerous technical issues and received substantial public criticism since its launch. Users have reported problems ranging from system errors, slow processing, and accessibility issues, raising concerns about the system’s effectiveness. Social media, particularly Twitter, has become a platform where taxpayers express their opinions, frustrations, and experiences regarding CORETAX. Understanding public sentiment towards CORETAX is crucial for evaluating its reception, identifying key concerns, and providing insights for future improvements.


## **Problem Statement**

How has the public responded to the implementation of CORETAX? Is public perception of CORETAX positive or negative?

## **Stakeholders**
The primary stakeholder of this project is **Director of Taxation Information and Technology (Direktur Teknologi Informasi Perpajakan - TIP)** within the **Indonesian Tax Ministry (Direktorat Jendral Pajak - DJP)** since the TIP department oversees the ongoing implementation of CORETAX and would likely be interested in public feedback.

## **Approach**

This study conducts sentiment analysis from scraped posts from the social media X to gauge public reaction to CORETAX. We collect tweets/posts related to "CORETAX" and classify them into binary (positive or negative) sentiments.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, such as tokenization and sentiment classification, are used to identify the prevailing public mood and trend regarding CORETAX.

The results will provide insights into public perception and highlight areas for improvement.
